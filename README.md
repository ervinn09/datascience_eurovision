# Data science - Eurovision



# Clone the repository

Download the files and folders manually one by one or clone the repository using:

**_git clone https://git.tu-berlin.de/hzemlin/eurovision.git_**
# How to bring the code to run

Be sure to have Python 3.9 or newer installed in your laptop

You need to have/install the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn 
- numpy.polynomial.polynomial
- os

(Another way) Install anaconda, which will install all of the above automatically

**make sure to run these commands first 'pip install openpyxl' and 'conda install openpyxl'**


# Run the code

First you have to make sure that the environment in which you are working on, is the one where you have installed all of the needed libraires. 

You can run the code in many different ways. 


One way is to open the terminal in the path of the repository and **run the command**: 

_1. python3 imp.py or python imp.py , ..._


The other method is to open imp.py in an IDE of your choice (for example Spyder), and change the environment to the one where the libraries are installed. 

_2. All that is left to do is to click on "Run"_

**The files to run are**

- neighbours_voting.ipynb for the plots of first  Data question

- imp.py for the plots of second  Data question

- language_similarity.py for the plots of third Data question

# Results

The graphs with which we answer our data questions will pop up in your screen if you run the code in the terminal, or they will appear in the "Plots" category in the IDE. 

# Research report

[Here](https://git.tu-berlin.de/hzemlin/eurovision/-/blob/main/2023_DS_Research_Report.pdf)  you will find a detailed explanation of what we have been working on to come to these conclusions, and what is to be learned from this research.
